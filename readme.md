# Data preparation toolbox for pansharpening algorithm.

1. npy-matlab-master is a numpy io package in Matlab or Octave from  [![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/kwikteam/npy-matlab.svg?branch=master "Travis")](https://travis-ci.org/kwikteam/npy-matlab)
2. crop_img.m crops HS/MS/PAN images to patches of a pre-defined size and gives the corresponding color patch for visualization.
3. generate_RR_samples.m generates samples at reduced-resolution.
